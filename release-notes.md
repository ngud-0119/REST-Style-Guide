# Release Notes

The Fuel REST API Style Guide is a document describing the Developer Experience of
Fuel REST APIs.  

This Style Guide is versioned according to a set of features to be supported by
v4 of the REST API.  Each Sub-version (4.x) is meant to describe a set of functionality
described and made available via the Framework. It is a goal, but not a guarantee,
