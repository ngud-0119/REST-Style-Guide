# TopicFilter Service

## Get Topic Filters

Returns a collection of Keyword Query Topic Filters to which the requesting user has access.

<pre>GET /v3/topics</pre>

Requires "auth_token" and "auth_appkey" HTTP headers to be set on request.
List of topic filters returned depends on user's ORG ROLE (super user has ability to list all public topic profiles across client id) and whether topic profiles are shared with user via project membership.
Nate that this endpoint is not intended to fetch information on keyword groups and queries.
