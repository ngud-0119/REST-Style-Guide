## Server

The Server that is responsible for handling API requests and responses.  

## Resource
The "R" in URL. i.e. Any part of the URL is considered a resource identifier
for the purposes of this document. Whether the resource references a complete
collection, only partially identifies a collection, or a specific item is
immaterial. Views are not a resource.

## Query String
Should not be to long. Should not radically change a routes behavior.

## Collections
Routes that return multiple objects are collections.

## Relationship
Between two objects, a reference.  Only exists between a root level resource
and its sub-resources; exists for 1-n and n-n resources.

## Partial Responses
The ability to restrict the display of properties on a Resource.  Useful when an API consumer wants only a limited set of properties from a resource.

## Views
A view is an expanded representation of a resource.

## Filtering
